# Hypermedia-project.-Part-1.-Standard-submission

Information architecture:
  First I did a header to put on my name, a photo of myself and what I am doing right now and where telling that I am studying
  Computer Science in the Girona Public College. 
  Then I made two parts. On the one hand, the left one is more visual and with less amount of text. On the other hand we have
  the right one with more text explaining more information of myself.
  The left part shows 3 parts:
    - My personal data like when I was born, my phone number, where do I live and my e-mail direction.
    - A visual graphic to show my principal skills
    - Finally we can see the languages that I speak (catalan and spanish being my normal native language and a B2 level of english)
  The right part also shows us 3 different parts:
    - Introduction of who I am, some adjectives to describe me as a person,...
    - My educational background
    - My experience in the labor sector and the time I have worked

Visual design:
  I wanted to put relevant enough information but not fill the screen with characters so I tried to do a balance between text and visual
  info. 
  One clear example is the progressive bars that I use. They describe my level on certains skills that i put on about myself and they describe also
  my level on languages.
  I have used some images on the page, for example I have put some small accompanying images in each of the sections
  in which they are found and I also put a photo of myself in the header.
  I have opted for dark colors to give easy reading and so that your eyes do not go to a specific area but rather you have to see the entire document.
